# JavaScript Repository Overview

This repository contains a collection of JavaScript examples and exercises organized into folders. Below is an overview of the structure and content:

## Folder Structure

### 01_basics

This folder contains introductory JavaScript concepts and examples, including:

- Variables and constants (`let`, `const`, `var`)
- Data types (strings, numbers, booleans, etc.)
- Basic operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)
- Control structures (if-else, switch-case)
- Loops (for, while, do-while)

### 02_basics

This folder builds upon the foundational concepts and includes:

- Functions (declaration, expression, arrow functions)
- Arrays and array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`)
- Objects and object manipulation
- DOM manipulation basics
- Event handling in JavaScript

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired folder:
   ```bash
   cd 01_basics
   ```
3. Open the files in your favorite code editor to explore the examples.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of programming concepts.
- A modern web browser or Node.js installed for running JavaScript code.
